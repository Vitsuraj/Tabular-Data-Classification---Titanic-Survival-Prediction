# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Model
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using popular ML libraries.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Load and preprocess Titanic dataset
✅ Handle missing values and feature encoding
✅ Train and evaluate multiple ML models
✅ Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
✅ Make predictions on new passenger data

# 📂 Dataset
Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
The dataset includes passenger details such as age, fare, gender, class, and survival status.

# 🛠 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Download the dataset:
Place train.csv and test.csv in the project directory.

# 📜 Usage
🔹 Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Run the following script to clean and preprocess the dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py
🔹 Step 2: Train the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
🔹 Step 3: Make Predictions
bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --input "sample_passenger.csv"
🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ Preprocessing:

Handles missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
Converts categorical data (Sex, Embarked) into numerical features
Scales numerical features (Fare, Age)
2️⃣ Feature Engineering:
Creates new features like Family Size and Title Extraction
3️⃣ Model Training:
Trains multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
4️⃣ Prediction:
Uses the best-performing model to predict survival on new passenger data
# 📌 Example
Predict Survival for a New Passenger:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --input "sample_passenger.csv"
Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Passenger ID: 1043
Predicted Survival: Survived (1)
# 📚 Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn
Install them via:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 🎯 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	80.3%	78.5%	75.6%	76.9%
Random Forest	85.2%	82.8%	80.2%	81.4%
XGBoost	87.1%	85.4%	83.2%	84.3%
# 💡 Future Improvements
✅ Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
✅ Use deep learning (Neural Networks)
✅ Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
